Kota Gullu were constructed by King Ganapatideva, the king of Kakatiya dynasty who ruled during the period of 1199–1260 CE.[1] It suffered major damage either through the attacks from the Muslim armies between 14th and 16th centuries CE, or through a major earthquake in the region in 17th century CE.

An inscription on a slab at the temple refers to Ganapathi Reddy who installed Lord Ganapateshwara and donated land during the reign of Ganapatideva in the cyclic year of “Jaya Nama Samvatsara, Vaisakha Sudha Trayodasi, Bruhaspati Vasaram” (corresponding to 1234-35 CE)
